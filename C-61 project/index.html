        <p>My favorite hobbies are Gaming, Drawing, and coding. Gaming is the most funest one of them all because you get to play with people online. Drawing is fun also because you get to draw anything that you want and it's sometimes looks beautiful sometimes it looks like a bad drawing but most people drawing are beautiful. Coding is fun because you get to make your own website you can make your own game and you can get a lot of money out of coding.</p>

        <p>I'm is a Coder, Gamer, and creative at drawing. I was born in August 29 2011. i was in Long-Branch New-Jersey United states of America. Cystic fibrosis of say CF as a shorter way so... CF is a rare disease it can damage your lungs/organs or something like that if you have this disease your routine is probably different so i have to put this machine on my body and this weird shaped mask so what the machine does is it shakes your body and makes your mucus more loose.</p>
